Hey Viewer!

Made this Amazon Web Scrapping Model that utilizes Beautiful Soup library (python) to perform the Data Scrapping to conduct the product mapping and price analysis.

The code might look small, but even this small code let me understand the basics of both the HTML, and Web Development.

The Project will soon be expanded to cover other websites that are utilized by my team to conduct product mapping on a day to day basis in order to enhance the analysis process.

!To be deployed soon!
